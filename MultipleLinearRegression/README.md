# Multiple Linear Regression

This folder contains a simple implementation of Multiple Linear Regression, a linear approach to modeling the relationship between a dependent variable $y$ and multiple independent variables $X$.

## Overview

Multiple Linear Regression is an extension of Simple Linear Regression that allows us to model a dependent variable based on multiple features. It fits a hyperplane in the feature space that minimizes the sum of squared errors between the predicted and actual values.

### Model Equation

The model for Multiple Linear Regression is represented as:

$$
y = b_0 + b_1 \cdot x_1 + b_2 \cdot x_2 + \dots + b_n \cdot x_n
$$

where:
- $y$: Predicted output (dependent variable)
- $x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n$: Independent variables (features)
- $b_0$: Intercept term
- $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$: Coefficients of the model for each feature

### Formula for Coefficients

To find the optimal coefficients $\beta$ (which include $b_0, b_1, \dots, b_n$), the model uses the **Normal Equation**:

$$
\beta = (X^T X)^{-1} X^T y
$$

where:
- $X$: Matrix of input features with an additional column of 1â€™s (for the intercept)
- $y$: Vector of target values

## Class Contents

The `MultipleLinearRegression` class has two primary methods:
- **fit(X_train, y_train)**: Calculates the coefficients by fitting the model to the training data.
- **predict(X_test)**: Uses the trained model to predict values for the test data.

## Usage

### Requirements

- Python 3
- NumPy
- Sklearn

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
pip install library_name
```
Replace `library_name` with the actual library name.

### Example Code

Below is an example demonstrating how to use the `MultipleLinearRegression` class in Python.

```python
import numpy as np
from MultipleLinearRegression import MultipleLinearRegression

# Sample training data
X_train = np.array([[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4], [4, 5]])
y_train = np.array([5, 7, 9, 11])

# Initialize the model
model = MultipleLinearRegression()

# Fit the model on the training data
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Sample test data
X_test = np.array([[5, 6], [6, 7]])
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Output predictions
print("Predictions:", y_pred)
```
### Explanation of Attributes
- `intercept_` : The intercept $b_0$ in the regression equation.
- `coef_` : The coefficients $b_1, b_2, \dots, b_n$ for each feature in the model.
