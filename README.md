# Algorithms Repository

This repository contains various algorithm implementations, each organized into individual folders. Each folder includes the code, examples, and documentation specific to the algorithm, designed to support clear understanding and ease of use.

## Repository Structure

Each algorithm is stored in its own folder, with the following structure:

- **AlgorithmName**: Folder representing a specific algorithm.
  - **README.md**: Documentation explaining the algorithm, mathematical background, and usage.
  - **Implementation**: Code file or Jupyter notebook with the algorithm implementation.
  - **Sample Data (optional)**: Example datasets if the algorithm requires specific data.
  - **Examples (optional)**: Code examples or additional files demonstrating the algorithm’s use.

## Getting Started

To use any algorithm:
1. Navigate to the specific algorithm’s folder.
2. Refer to the `README.md` inside for background information, instructions, and requirements.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebook or Python file to review or run the implementation.
